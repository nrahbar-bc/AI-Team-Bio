## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

## Built With

Built with WP Gutenberg Block & ChatGPT 3.5 API.

## Getting Started

Install the plugin & use it on page/post editor.

## Usage
